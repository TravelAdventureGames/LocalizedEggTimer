The cooling water needs to be really cold, otherwise you will not achieve the desired doneness.</li><li>Take multiple cooling bowls (one for soft boiled, one for hard boiled, ect.) In that way you can keep track of which egg was which afterwards.</li><li>In order to make the peeling of the egg much easier, add some vinegar to the water.</li><li>In the US it's recommended to store your eggs in the fridge. Due to a different production process than in Europe, the risk of salmonella poisoning when storing eggs outside the fridge, is higher in the US.</ul>";

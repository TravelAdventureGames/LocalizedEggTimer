Your cooling water needs to be really cold, otherwise you will not achieve your desired doneness.</li><li>Take multiple cooling bowls (one for soft boiled, one for hard boiled, ect.) In that way you can tell which egg was which afterwards.</li><li>In order to make the peeling of the egg much easier, add some vinegar to the water.</li></ul>";
